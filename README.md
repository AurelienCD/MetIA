# MetIA

Please find the code used in the study "Routine implementation of deep learning algorithm for automatic brain metastases segmentation on MRI for RANO-BM criteria follow-up" submitted to "Research in Diagnostic and Interventional Imaging"

The aim of these code is to :
  - obtain RTSTRUCT metrics
  - analyse the difference between these metrics in reference and AI predicted brain metastases lesions ROI

Code for the Back and the Front of the UI is available at "https://github.com/VendenIX/BrainMetaSegmentatorUI-Back" and "https://github.com/VendenIX/BrainMetaSegmentatorUI-Front"
